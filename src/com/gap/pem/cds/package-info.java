/**
 * Multi-Dimensional Analytic Platform: Provides classes to hold and analyze multidimensional data in memory.
 * <p>Multidimensional data is organized in Dimensions, which define hierarchies of attributes
 * that characterize data items, such as product categories, or locations.  Data items are defined
 * in terms of the intersection of one or more dimensions, and data values associated with those items
 * are stored in Measures attached to intersections.
