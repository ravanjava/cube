/**
 * Demo and tutorials for developers to learn about MDAP usage.  Step through the
 * classes that have main() methods to see techniques in use.
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Demo1_CollectorInitialization:  Illustrates instantiating a Collector instance and
 *     populating Dimensions and Intersections.</li>
 *     <li>Demo2_Metadata:  Illustrates the use of metadata API calls and how to navigate hierarchies.</li>
 *     <li>Demo3_DataStores:  Illustrates the use of data stores to hold measure values at intersections.</li>
 *     <li>Demo4_Aggregation:  Illustrates the two alternative aggregation strategies - using Filters, or using
 *     AggregationController.</li>
 *     <li>Demo5_ProjectionsAndShadows:  Illustrates MDAP features for projecting a selection at an upper level
 *     onto an intersection and for finding the "shadow" of items on an intersection that are descended from a
 *     tuple of level members.</li>
 *     <li>Demo6_AttributeHierarchy:  Illustrates the creation of new hierarchies that contain attributes other
 *     than member names.</li>
 * </ul>
